# SugarSense Application

The SugarSense application is a user classification tool designed to determine whether individuals are likely to have diabetes or not, based on a set of questions and answers (QnA). By analyzing the responses provided by users, the application employs a classification algorithm to distinguish between diabetes and non-diabetes cases. This tool aims to offer a quick initial assessment and encourage users to seek professional medical advice if necessary. It provides a user-friendly interface for answering the questions and receiving the classification results. Please note that the application's classifications are not a substitute for medical diagnosis; they serve as an informational resource to raise awareness about diabetes risks.
